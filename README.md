# Godot-Dress-up-Game
This is my first Godot Project. 


So this is a Dress Up game using GD Script

->In this game, you can drag the object from the wardrobe and place it on the character present

->If the object (cloth piece) is not placed in the right area, it will return back to its original area. 

For Eg: if the hat was dragged from the wardrobe, and was placed near shoes area of the character then it will return to the wardrobe.
